# Blade Mode Replicate

https://github.com/brian6030/ThirdPersonAction/assets/27403866/5dbd79bf-06a7-4599-932a-fdc34aeb0afc

This third-person demo replicates the Blade Mode mechanics from Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance. It allows cutting through both static meshes and skinned meshes. The slicing mechanism is based on [ezy-slice](https://github.com/DavidArayan/ezy-slice).
